# How to use ProductBoard

## Flagging Tickets as Needing Feedback from Product

From the Zendesk Agent interface, a ticket needs to be tagged as:

* Feature Request
* Needs follow-up from Product Team

Once done, any update on the ticket will be pushed to [ProductBoard as an insight](https://stoplightio.productboard.com/insights). These tickets are then reviewed by the Product team and can be reviewed in collaboration with Customer Success on the bi-weekly product syncs.
