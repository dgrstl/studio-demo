# Ticket Triage

## Triage

Before opening an issue with Engineering:

* Search in the issue [search](http://github.com/stoplightio/platform-internal/issues) for any relevant errors/jargon. _If there is already an existing issue, comment on that ticket instead of creating a new one._
* If the error is unknown:
  * If unclear on where the error is occurring, ask requester for screenshot/video/gif.
  * Ask requester for screenshot/capture of developer console \(docs link [here](https://support.stoplight.io/hc/en-us/articles/360034152371-Opening-your-browser-s-developer-tools)\).
  * Ask for any relevant actions that reproduces the error \(clicking X, adding Y model, etc\). _Be sure to include these items in the issue._
  * Ask if refreshing resolves the issue \(could be related to [this](https://github.com/stoplightio/platform-internal/issues/2301) issue\).

## Creating Issues

Issues should always be logged in the [platform-internal](https://github.com/stoplightio/platform-internal/issues) repository. Also:

* Include a link to the Zendesk ticket in the issue/comment.
* If a specific error message is logged \(for example, "Cannot read property..."\), be sure to include the _text_ of that message in the issue body.
* Add to [Customer Success Project](https://github.com/orgs/stoplightio/projects/5) for tracking purposes.
